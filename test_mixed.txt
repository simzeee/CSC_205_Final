This is a terrible and awful situation. I feel horrible and sad about everything. The ugly weather makes me feel miserable and depressed. Life is bad and dreadful. I hate this disappointing experience. This is a wonderful and amazing day. I feel great and happy about everything. The beautiful sunshine makes me feel joyful and excited. Life is excellent and fantastic. I love this brilliant experience.
